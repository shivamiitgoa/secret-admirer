# Sora Variants - 2026-02 Launch

## Variant A: 15s vertical cutdown (9:16)

Goal: fast social reel/shorts version focused on the core USP.

Timing:
- 0-4s: fear of rejection moment
- 4-10s: private signal + mutual reveal rule
- 10-15s: payoff + end card

Required text:
- "Private signals. Mutual reveal."
- "Your crush never knows unless feelings are mutual."
- "MutualWink" + "mutualwink.com"

Notes:
- Keep shots tightly framed for vertical composition.
- Reduce text count to preserve clarity on small screens.

## Variant B: Hook-first teaser (30s)

Open with bold hook text in first 2 seconds:
- "What if your crush only knew when it was mutual?"

Then follow the same arc as master prompt with slightly faster first half.

## Variant C: Privacy-first teaser (30s)

Emphasize account anonymity before reveal mechanics.

Text priority order:
1. "No one knows whether you have an account."
2. "Private signals. Mutual reveal."
3. "Your crush never knows unless feelings are mutual."

## Editing notes for all variants

- Avoid platform-specific visual branding.
- Keep expressions subtle and genuine.
- Maintain respectful, non-judgmental tone.
- Preserve end card legibility for at least 1.5 seconds.
