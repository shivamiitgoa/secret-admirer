# MutualWink Product Context

## Product identity

- Name: MutualWink
- Positioning line: "Private signals. Mutual reveal."

## Founder motivation

MutualWink is built for moments when two people may like each other but neither feels safe expressing it first.
The goal is to create a space where people can share interest without fear of rejection or judgment.
Only mutual feelings unlock identity, so emotional risk is reduced.

## Primary audience

Anyone who has a crush on someone and is not comfortable expressing those feelings directly.

## Top outcomes

- Users feel safe while expressing interest.
- Users feel their privacy is protected as a priority.
- Users feel empowered to connect when feelings are mutual.

## USPs

- "No one knows whether you have an account or not."
- "It is safe: your crush will never know unless feelings are mutual."

## Hosting and platform context

- Production URL: <https://mutualwink.com>
- Legacy redirect URL: <https://secret-admirer-app.web.app>
- Stack: React, Vite, Firebase Hosting, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Firebase App Check

## Messaging guardrails

- Do not promise account-anonymity as an absolute claim until privacy hardening is deployed to production.
- Mutual reveal and safety messaging can be highlighted immediately.
